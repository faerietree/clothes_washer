Goals
---
* Wash clothes.
* Low-tech, i.e. it could be an easy to construct river machine.
* Long-life.
* Mobile?
* Different rotation speed required or use common induction motor speed, i.e. approximately 1450, or half of it is enough to lengthen life of bearings?
* Could try to gather required water from the air or over night in hot climates. Though that should be a component/repository on its own as it has more purposes, i.e. getting drinking water after filtering. 
* Work with little chemicals, and if, then use what is available or can be manufactured using other open source modules.
